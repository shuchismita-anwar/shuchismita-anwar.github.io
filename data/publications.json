    "description": "Two-stage multimodal framework that integrates chest X-ray images, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist gaze data. A gaze-guided contrastive model improves disease classification (F1 up 5.7%, AUC up 3.4%), while a region-grounded report generation pipeline produces more accurate and interpretable radiology reports.",
